# BookTok — Content & Creator Guidelines

Purpose: Keep trailers spoiler‑safe, high-quality, and legal.

## Golden Rules
- Length: 30–90 seconds. Keep it tight and cinematic.
- Spoilers: No plot twists, endings, or key reveals. Use “tease, don’t tell.”
- Quotes: Max 100 words total quoted text; attribute properly. Prefer paraphrase/summary.
- Audio Quality: Clear voice, minimal background noise. Avoid copyrighted music unless you own/ licensed it.
- Respect & Safety: No hate, harassment, or adult content targeting minors.
- Book Metadata: Select the correct ISBN/title/author; mislabeling may be removed.

## Disallowed Content
- Pirated readings or full chapters; more than “short excerpt” of text/audio.
- Hateful, sexual content involving minors, incitement to violence.
- Spam, scams, or deceptive claims.

## Best Practices
- Structure: Hook (10–15s) → Vibe/Theme (30–45s) → Who will love it (10–15s).
- Tagging: Use 3–5 accurate mood/genre tags; add content warnings when relevant.
- Levels: Keep peaks at -3 dBFS; use noise reduction; no clipping.

## Enforcement
- 3-strike policy for policy violations (warning → temp suspension → ban).
- Copyright complaints: DMCA takedown process with counter-notice route.
- Appeals: In-app form; reviewed within 7 days.

## Legal
- You affirm you have rights to all content you upload.
- Commercial/disclosure: Sponsored trailers must be labeled “Sponsored.”
